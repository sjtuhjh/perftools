This version is strongly inspired by Glen Fawcetts version (and oracle's statspack obviously).
Some fields have been chopped off Glen's version, in order to be able to run this on a 8.1 version database.

This is work in progress, so feel free to add features or corrections. 
Please post questions, additions or suggestions to uwe.bartels@gmail.com.

For sample cron entries see Automated Snapshots section at the bottom of this file.

Upgrade (All existing users should upgrade as there have been changes to the stored functions):

1. Delete files from old install new version has a cleaned up file layout
2. Untar contents to new install location
3. Run the upgrade_pgstatspack.sh as the postgres OS user
4. Check output for errors
5. Create a cron job to call the snapshot.sh for automated snapshot creation recommended every 15 minutes
6. Create a daily cron job to delete old snapshots

Installation: (Run all scripts as the postgres OS user)

1. Create or use a postgresql user which has superuser privilege
2. Run the install_pgstats.sh this will install the script on all databases except the postgres db and templates 
3. Check the output for errors
4. Create a cron job to call the snapshot.sh for automated snapshot creation recommended every 15 minutes
5. Create a daily cron job to delete old snapshots

Reinstalling:

->The scripts will drop database objects prior to creating them. Already existent data will be DELETED!

1. Use the existing postgresql superuser and schema.
2. -If needed- backup existing data using pg_dump -U <user> -t 'pgstatspack*' -f pgstatspack_dump.sql <database>
3. Run the remove_statspack.sh
4. Run the install_pgstats.sh script
5. Create a cron job to call the snapshot.sh for automated snapshot creation recommended every 15 minutes
6. Create a daily cron job to delete old snapshots


pgstatspack is now ready.

Create snapshot:

There are several methods to creating snapshots within the database.

Manually create a snapshot

  Use the same user which is the owner of the function and the tables.

  Snapshot without comment:

    select pgstatspack_snap('');

  Snapshot with comment:
 
    select pgstatspack_snap('my comment');

Automated snapshots

  Create a cron job for the postgres OS user I suggest every 15 minutes

    */15 * * * *    /somepath/pgstatspack/bin/snapshot.sh 1> /some_path/log_file 2>&1

  Don't forget to purge old snapshots I suggest keeping about 30 days this will run at 0302

    2 3 * * *       /somepath/pgstatspack/bin/delete_snapshot.sh 1> /some_path/log_file 2>&1

Create a report:

Reporting is done using the pgstatspack_report.sh shellscript.

If the database username and database name are the same as your current operating system username:

./pgstatspack_report.sh

If the database username and/or the database name are different, execute pgstatspack_report.sh the following way:

./pgstatspack_report.sh <username> <database>

Next, the script displays all the snapshosts available, and asks for a begin snapshot and an end snapshot.
